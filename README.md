# EQUIVOX
A Real-Time AI Platform That Anonymizes Accents + Quantifies Idea Quality in Hiring

Human potential is often filtered through irrelevant markers: accent, gender, race, school prestige. Research shows 72% of non-native speakers face accent discrimination in hiring (McKinsey, HBR). Traditional “solutions” like accent training or translation reinforce standard-accent dominance, instead of dismantling bias.

Equivox is an AI fairness platform that ensures candidates are judged only on clarity of thought and problem-solving ability — not accent, not gender, not skin tone, not pedigree.

Key Innovations:

    1) Accent-Invariant AI
              Speech embeddings stripped of accent features (Wav2Vec2.0 + adversarial debiasing).
              Real-time anonymization filter for both virtual & physical interviews.
    
    2) Clarity & Idea Scoring
              Idea Density →  of novel concepts per minute.
              Argument Cohesion → semantic graph analysis (spaCy + NetworkX).
              Contextual Precision → BERT-based alignment to question asked
    3) Bias Sentinel
              Continuous monitoring post-hiring (performance reviews, promotions).
              Detects systemic bias (“Seraiki speakers rated 0.4 lower in reviews”).
              Generates Blockchain-verified Fairness Certificates for companies.
    4) Counterfactual Fairness
              Simulates candidate outcomes under different accents, genders, or names.
              Quantifies “bias penalty” → then neutralizes it in evaluation.
Why This Matters
     Tackles UN SDG 8 (Decent Work) + SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).
     Creates a scientific framework for fairness audits that could become as standard as financial audits.
     Positions hiring fairness as an AI + ethics grand challenge, not just a software project.
